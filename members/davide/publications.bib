  abstract  = {Oxford COVID-19 Database (OxCOVID19 Database) is a comprehensive source of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This relational database contains time-series data on epidemiology, government responses, mobility, weather and more across time and space for all countries at the national level, and for more than 50 countries at the regional level. It is curated from a variety of (wherever available) official sources. Its purpose is to facilitate the analysis of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus and to assess the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the impact of the pandemic. Our database is a freely available, daily updated tool that provides unified and granular information across geographical regions.Design typeData integration objectiveMeasurement(s)Coronavirus infectious disease, viral epidemiologyTechnology type(s)Digital curationFactor types(s)Sample characteristic(s)Homo sapiens},

  abstract  = {Mapper and Ball Mapper are Topological Data Analysis tools used for exploring high dimensional point clouds and visualizing scalar–valued functions on those point clouds. Inspired by open questions in knot theory, new features are added to Ball Mapper that enable encoding of the structure, internal relations and symmetries of the point cloud. Moreover, the strengths of Mapper and Ball Mapper constructions are combined to create a tool for comparing high dimensional data descriptors of a single dataset. This new hybrid algorithm, Mapper on Ball Mapper, is applicable to high dimensional lens functions. As a proof of concept we include applications to knot and game theory.},

  abstract   = {Tools of topological data analysis provide stable summaries encapsulating the shape of the considered data. Persistent homology, the most standard and well-studied data summary, suffers a number of limitations; its computations are hard to distribute, and it is hard to generalize to multifiltrations and is computationally prohibitive for big datasets. In this article, we study the concept of Euler characteristics curves for 1-parameter filtrations and Euler characteristic profiles for multiparameter filtrations. While being a weaker invariant in one dimension, we show that Euler characteristic–based approaches do not possess some handicaps of persistent homology; we show efficient algorithms to compute them in a distributed way, their generalization to multifiltrations, and practical applicability for big data problems. In addition, we show that the Euler curves and profiles enjoy a certain type of stability, which makes them robust tools for data analysis. Lastly, to show their practical applicability, multiple use cases are considered.},

  abstract  = {Identifying molecular signatures from complex disease patients with underlying symptomatic similarities is a significant challenge in the analysis of high dimensional multi-omics data. Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a way of extracting such information from the geometric structure of the data and identifying multiway higher-order relationships. Here, we propose an application of Harmonic persistent homology, which overcomes the limitations of ambiguous assignment of the topological information to the original elements in a representative topological cycle from the data. When applied to multi-omics data, this leads to the discovery of hidden patterns highlighting the relationships between different omic profiles, while allowing for common tasks in multi-omics analyses, such as disease subtyping, and most importantly biomarker identification for similar latent biological pathways that are associated with complex diseases. Our experiments on multiple cancer data show that harmonic persistent homology effectively dissects multi-omics data to identify biomarkers by detecting representative cycles predictive of disease subtypes.},
