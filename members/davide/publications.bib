	abstract = {Oxford COVID-19 Database (OxCOVID19 Database) is a comprehensive source of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This relational database contains time-series data on epidemiology, government responses, mobility, weather and more across time and space for all countries at the national level, and for more than 50 countries at the regional level. It is curated from a variety of (wherever available) official sources. Its purpose is to facilitate the analysis of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus and to assess the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the impact of the pandemic. Our database is a freely available, daily updated tool that provides unified and granular information across geographical regions.Design typeData integration objectiveMeasurement(s)Coronavirus infectious disease, viral epidemiologyTechnology type(s)Digital curationFactor types(s)Sample characteristic(s)Homo sapiens},

	abstract = {This work brings methods from topological data analysis to knot theory and develops new data analysis tools inspired by this application. We explore a vast collection of knot invariants and relations between then using Mapper and Ball Mapper algorithms. In particular, we develop versions of the Ball Mapper algorithm that incorporate symmetries and other relations within the data, and provide ways to compare data arising from different descriptors, such as knot invariants. Additionally, we extend the Mapper construction to the case where the range of the lens function is high dimensional rather than a 1-dimensional space, that also provides ways of visualizing functions between high-dimensional spaces. We illustrate the use of these techniques on knot theory data and draw attention to potential implications of our findings in knot theory.},

	abstract = {Tools of Topological Data Analysis provide stable summaries encapsulating the shape of the considered data. Persistent homology, the most standard and well studied data summary, suffers a number of limitations; its computations are hard to distribute, it is hard to generalize to multifiltrations and is computationally prohibitive for big data-sets. In this paper we study the concept of Euler Characteristics Curves, for one parameter filtrations and Euler Characteristic Profiles, for multi-parameter filtrations. While being a weaker invariant in one dimension, we show that Euler Characteristic based approaches do not possess some handicaps of persistent homology; we show efficient algorithms to compute them in a distributed way, their generalization to multifiltrations and practical applicability for big data problems. In addition we show that the Euler Curves and Profiles enjoys certain type of stability which makes them robust tool in data analysis. Lastly, to show their practical applicability, multiple use-cases are considered.},
