  abstract     = {In topological data analysis (TDA), persistence diagrams (PDs) have been a successful tool. To compare them, Wasserstein and bottleneck distances are commonly used. We address the shortcomings of these metrics and show a way to investigate them in a systematic way by introducing bottleneck profiles. This leads to a notion of discrete Prokhorov metrics for PDs as a generalization of the bottleneck distance. These metrics satisfy a stability result and can be used to bound Wasserstein metrics from above and from below. We provide algorithms to compute the newly introduced quantities and end with an discussion about experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper adopts a tool from computational topology, the Euler characteristic curve (ECC) of a sample, to perform one- and two-sample goodness of fit tests. We call our procedure TopoTests. The presented tests work for samples of arbitrary dimension, having comparable power to the state-of-the-art tests in the one-dimensional case. It is demonstrated that the type I error of TopoTests can be controlled and their type II error vanishes exponentially with increasing sample size. Extensive numerical simulations of TopoTests are conducted to demonstrate their power for samples of various sizes.},

  abstract    = {Given a probability distribution \$F\$ on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\textasciicircum d\$ with density \$f\$, consider a sample \$X\_n\$ of \$n\$ points sampled from \$F\$ i.i.d.. We study the Euler characteristic of the union of balls \$\textbackslash bigcup\textbackslash limits\_\{x\textbackslash in X\_n\} \textbackslash overline\{B\}\_\{r\_n\}(x)\$ in the thermodynamic limit. That is, as \$n\textbackslash to\textbackslash infty\$, we let \$r\_n\textbackslash to 0\$ such that \$nr\_n\textasciicircum d\$ approaches a finite, non-zero limit. We express the limiting expected Euler characteristic of \$F\$ as an integral transform of that of the uniform distribution on \$[0,1]\textasciicircum d\$. This allows us to investigate under what conditions two distributions yield the same expected Euler characteristic in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that this happens if and only if the two distributions have the same excess mass transform. Our proofs are constructive and enable new explicit calculations of expected Euler characteristics in low dimensions.},

  abstract    = {In this paper, we introduce a density-sensitive bifiltration on Dowker complexes. Previously, Dowker complexes were studied to address directional or bivariate data whereas density-sensitive bifiltrations on \textbackslash v\{C\}ech and Vietoris--Rips complexes were suggested to make them more robust. We combine these two lines of research, noting that the superlevels of the total weight function of a Dowker complex can be identified as an instance of Sheehy's multicover filtration. An application of the multicover nerve theorem then provides a form of Dowker duality that is compatible with this filtration. As a consequence, we find that the subdivision intrinsic \textbackslash v\{C\}ech complex admits a smaller model. Moreover, regarding the total weight function as a counting measure, we generalize it to arbitrary measures and prove a density-sensitive stability theorem for the case of probability measures. Additionally, we provide an algorithm to calculate the appearances of simplices in our bifiltration and present computational examples.},
